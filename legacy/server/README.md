# FiveM Server Types

This package contains "easy-to-use" types for FiveM.

It contains every method which can be used on server side.

For client access see [this package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@risinglife/fivem-client)<br>
The package must be included when compile the code for example with **esbuild**.

### Since v0.2.0
All root methods (e.g. `server.taskShootAtEntity()`) are no longer supported.
The reason for this is clearly that namespaced methods are better and clearer.

This package can be used to support backward compatibility.
**Note:** This package is no longer being updated, so it is recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the package.
